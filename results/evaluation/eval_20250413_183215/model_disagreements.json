        "text": "My husband & I recently stayed at the Bellagio hotel we hadn't ever stayed there before & were expecting it to be top notch since it isn't exactly cheap to stay there. I'm giving them a 3 for a number or reasons I realize not everyone's experience won't be the same. \\n\\nPros:\\n1. The woman at the concierge desk was so extremely nice she blew me away she made sure Greg & I were well taken care of at the restaurant FIX & she told us all of her favorite things to eat. Also the woman who checked us into the hotel was very sweet & I could tell wanted to impress us. \\n\\n2.  FIX the restaurant was absolutely delicious! I highly recommend going there for dinner & getting the tacos & the fried Mac & cheese so so good. They were prompt with service & the waitress even placed our napkins in our laps which I found odd but still it is a very high class place. \\n\\n3. The sweet woman in the shop across from the elevators. She was so sweet & exhausted but she helped us & even chatted it up with us for a little while. \\n\\n4. Gorgeous downstairs & for the most part everyone that worked there was nice & said good morning or hello when you crossed their path. \\n\\nCons:\\n1. We got there early so I didn't expect a room to be ready right away & was told that they'd text us when our room was ready. We arrived at 7am & still didn't get a text by 12:30pm which sucked cause we still had to get ready for the event we had planned at 2pm we also had a drive ahead of us & didn't know what the traffic would be like. So we called to check to see if the room was done or if another one like the one booked was available yet. Well the room wasn't ready it was suppose to have a garden/pool view we asked if another one exactly like it was ready otherwise we'd still wait. They switched us to another one which I assume was suppose to be like it I could be wrong but they told us to go up to that room after almost getting to the elevators they called to say go to the front desk for new keys to activate. We got to the desk & the new lady was pretty rude we told her what happened she got all pissy & said \\\"who are you? Let me see your ID.\\\" My husband gave it to her and she then looked up the room she said \\\"it isn't even listed on here so I'll have to give you something else like it.\\\" She gave us the new card keys & we headed up to the room. It was pretty lame we got a king size bed but there was nothing special about the room or the view we got a view of the freeway definitely a downgrade from the garden/pool view. The tub & pillows are nice though.\\n\\n2. After a long day at the Vegas speedway we wanted to take a nap & refresh our batteries for the night out, we were on our way up to our room when we were stopped at the elevator entrance by someone that worked there he yelled \\\"um excuse me you two! Room keys?\\\" I wouldn't have minded him saying this but since we were the only ones he stopped to see the room keys it was rude & I didn't appreciate the look or tone of voice he gave us. I'm not sure if he was having a crappy day or didn't want to be there. \\n\\nAt the end of the trip although I liked the food at fix & some of the people that worked there I wasn't the impressed with the hotel rooms or the view. I don't think id stay here again unless it was extremely discounted.",

My boyfriend fell fast asleep and stayed that way for the majority of the show. Are you serious?!!?! \\n\\nBefore the show started, the guy behind us pretty much summed up how the Cirque du Soleil experience SHOULD be: \\\"I don't care about a story line; I only care about how close to death the performers are. The closer to death, the more entertaining for me.\\\" EXACTLY.\\n\\nAt no point was anyone close to death during Ka. And I shouldn't have to follow a boring dialogue-less story to watch a Cirque show!! The moving stage is only cool for about 2 minutes. There were maybe 1 1/2 interesting acts (guys jump-roping on giant hamster wheels and some of the hanging-from-the-rope act).\\n\\nI can't believe this show is so much more expensive than the traveling shows. I have NEVER been disappointed by a traveling show. I most recently saw Kooza in Santa Monica, and it was breath-taking, hilarious, and jaw-droppingly amazing. Don't settle for less. \\n\\nSKIP KA and enjoy Vegas!",

        "text": "a rather blustry saturday morning (a sad reminder that winter is well on its way) i made my way to this bookshop slash cafe to have a coffee and a chat with the lovely Lou V.  now i'm not overly familiar with the whole quartermile, but after instructions from my dining companion i turned right at the starbucks and made my way along.  the shop is hard to miss though with the huge glass windows displaying a beautiful interior of colourful and well loved classic books behind a chic cafe with clear tables mixed amoung huge velvet purple couches.\\n\\ngetting there early i took a seat at one of the tables as the couches were occupied and proceeded to make a phone call while i wait.  now this place gets a immediate extra star because i was clearly very upset and crying on the phone and instead of looking at me disapprovingly the ladies working the cafe seemed to just get on with their business and leave me to be.  when Lou V. did arrive she took me and my sorry self to a newly emptied velvet sofa and bought me a cup of tea and a cheese scone.  the girl behind the counter was especially nice and made no comments as to the mascara that had migrated from my eyelashes to my cheeks.\\n\\nour hot drinks and my scone came promptly and i found it very lovely that my tea was a loose leaf which came with a little timer and instructions from the waitress to allow the tea to brew for two full turns of the timer.  very nice touch.  my cheese scone was huge as well and immediately slathered with butter for a quick bite into the comfort of cheese and carbs that i needed!  when poured my cranberry apple tea was a rich red colour and very comforting.\\n\\ndespite being blatently modern, i found this bookshop very cosy and welcoming.  it reminded me of the trendy boutique shops i've been to back in the states.  i also loved that they had beautiful coloured covers on the classic books that were on display and really used the huge space they had to fill up the shop nicely but not make it feel crowded.  i had a quick browse of the books before we left and felt a bit of sadness that i no longer buy real books since i've had my kindle as this would clearly be the ideal shop to get them at.\\n\\nnow my only complaint and why this place has gotten 3 stars instead of 4.  it was freezing!!  absolutely freezing!!! and i was wearing a cardigan and ugg boots, so clearly i should not have been so cold.... i don't know if it's because the place doesn't keep heat in well with the high ceilings and massive windows lining three out of four walls of the shop, but it was so cold that we opted to leave and get a second coffee elsewhere.  i think i will visit this shop again, but perhaps bring a few extra layers to keep warm or wait until a sunny summer's day when the warmth from the sun can heat the shop through the windows.",

        "text": "The only reason this is a 3-star review is because I love Avalon and have enjoyed every experience there up until last night's dinner. Otherwise, it would be a -5. Nothing is worth what I had to go through last night! The service was fabulous, as always, and the food was delicious. However, I got very sick a few hours after we left. I should have known it was a mistake to finish my scallop appetizer after I noticed the scallop was cold in the middle, but it was so tasty that I ate the whole thing anyway. Bad idea! I should have passed on the very yummy but very raw steak carpaccio amus\\u00e9 given to us after we sat down. I should have declined a taste of my boyfriend's medium rare duck breast. I should have sent back my undercooked butterfish. Come to think of it, even the beignets we had for dessert were lukewarm and runny in the middle (I still blame the scallops, however). Anyway, I simply adored the evening until I had to flush all of that fantastic food down the toilet. Needless to say, I'm really regretting that huge tip we left our server.\\n\\nI truly hope this is not a common occurance at Avalon. The chef is relatively new to the restaurant, but not inexperienced. The dining room was not all that busy, either, so what is the excuse for giving a loyal customer food poisoning? None. I'm so disappointed. My man and I will be finding a new place to call our own for next year's anniversary (yes, I spent the night of my anniversary celebration -- at the 3 Palms hotel, no less -- in the bathroom). Sorry, Avalon.",

We arrived at 8pm on a Saturday night ... no line at all to get in, and the seating was only half full. That told us something right away. We went to Caesars Bacchanal buffet two nights later and it was absolutely unbelievable. I could spend a whole week just trying all the selections available, and the food quality is top notch. The price was only $2.00/ea more than the Village Seafood Buffet, and there is no comparison. Go to Bacchanal, wait 20 - 30 minutes in line, then enter heaven.

        "text": "Yes, I also attended the soft opening.  Everyone there was excited and so friendly.  The actual grand opening is tomorrow so it will be interesting to see how they did.  \\n\\nWe just had to try the guacamole made at the table - the guac-chick was awsome.  They give you all kinds of options while preparing it.  It was fantastic....needed a little salt for my taste but pretty darn good.  Chips light and crispy-homemade.  Salsa just ok.\\n\\nFor entrees we ordered a chicken salad, steak pablano pepper and pork tacos.  All delish!  The chicken salad was full of flavor.  The steak pablano pepper (not sure if that was what it was called) was great.  The pepper stuffed with cheese, shrimp, onions and mushrooms sandwiched by a thin steak.  Wow.  Really wow.  Yum.  The tacos were good and flavorfull too.  My daughter ordered the corn dog (haha-kids) which they served honey mustard with which I thought was weird. lol  \\n\\nThe decor was very blah.  They sat us in the back facing a wall with nothing on it. Odd kind of ambiance.  Kadence was our waitress-she was fabulous!  Like I said everyone was fantastic-on their best behavior still learning everything and getting to know each other but seemed like a good future team. ;)\\n\\nThe best thing was the BROWNIE!  They said it takes SIX yes SIX hours to make!  What???  They prepare the brownie with some kind of cream sauce and ice cream on a skillet right at your table.  Unbelievable!  It sounded like alot of their desserts were specially made like that - at the table.  Very \\\"special\\\" kind of dessert.  I only planned to have a couple bites...uh yeah that didnt happen.  hahah  Bet you would say the same and change that thought.\\n\\n3 stars because they are not opened yet.  We will have to try it one more time to see.  The prices seem a little high-well some on them.  Our bill would have been about $90 with a margarita and a glass of wine.  Its worth a shot at least once.   Not sure when we will be back but if we do I will update this review.  Cheers!",

        "text": "So I finally got around to checking out Crystals and I left feeling like I had just bought a luxury car only to discover a scratch on the way home.  That's not to say I could actually afford to buy anything at Crystals beyond a chai latte.  But that's for another review.\\n\\nCrystals is the marquee shopping \\\"experience\\\" at CityCenter.  You can spot the spiky architecture from a mile away.  Inside is just as weird.  Lots of abstract art.  Even the stairs ooze expensive, probably built from the rarest trees this side of the Amazon.  But do you think anyone who would shop here actually cares about the consequence of gratuitous excess?  That's the whole point of Crystals!\\n\\nWhat struck me the most is how empty the place feels.  This is probably what the Fashion Show mall should have been before it was packed to the gills with Hot Topic, The Gap and Cinnabon.  Crystals is the opposite of that, and any other mall in Las Vegas.  There are maybe 25 stores.  If you even want to classify this as a mall.  It's essentially the same ultra-high end retailers you'd find at other casino mini-malls selling everything from couture to diamonds to watches.  Some places I've heard of like Tom Ford and Louis Vuitton, but there are quite a few I had never heard of before.  I guess they just want to remind the middle class tourists that they can look but can't touch.  At this point, nearly half of the stores aren't even open yet.\\n\\nFrom what I could gather, there are three levels at Crystals.  But level three seems to be just a way to get to the tram.  What earns this place three stars instead of two is the at-times stunning design and visuals.  Some of the sight-lines are downright fun.\\n\\nUltimately, I don't know who actually shops here.  Maybe the celebs who roll into town and want to be seen.  It's almost as though this is the retail equivalent of plastic surgery addiction.  Sooner or later you hit the point of diminishing returns and what was once beautiful becomes sad and depressing.",

Some people probably wouldn't like that, but when you've had a night of drinking, something about that 'fake cheese' (as I like to call it) is sooo good :)\\n\\nSecond time we were there I had the Cobb Salad, omg, fantastic! My husband had a Club Sandwich the first time and it was very good too. The portions they give you are hardy so you're payment won't go to waste.
